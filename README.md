Designing a news application while following the best android architecture practice MVVM

I took advantage of the free news API service offered by newsapi.org

I also took advantage of the best technologies so i could have a robust and scallable application

Each class has single function, and are grouped in various packages for easy description and identification

Technologies used include

1. Retrofit service for api consumption
2. Room to store saved data
3. Dependency injection to create retrofit and room dependencies
4. MVVM Archtecture
5. Diff Util
6. viewBinding
